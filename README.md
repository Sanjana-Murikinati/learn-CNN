# learn-CNN
A fun interactive game to learn CNNs in Machine Learning by building networks, visualizing feature maps, and optimizing models. Players tackle challenges like data augmentation and AI battles to master deep learning concepts. 🚀🎮
A fun, interactive game to learn Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in Machine Learning! 🎮🧠  

### **Game Concept:**  
- **"CNN Builder Challenge"** 🏗️: Players build a CNN by stacking layers (Conv, Pooling, Fully Connected) to classify images.  
- **"Feature Map Explorer"** 🔍: Visualize how filters detect edges, shapes, and patterns in real time.  
- **"Data Augmentation Race"** 🚀: Apply transformations (rotation, flipping, noise) to improve model performance.  
- **"CNN Boss Battle"** 👾: Compete against an AI-powered adversary by tweaking CNN parameters for better accuracy.  

📊 **Learn concepts like filters, feature extraction, backpropagation, and overfitting—all while playing!** 🎯
